# lmg_news_app_demo

A Simple Flutter New app

## Getting Started
- please refer the development branch

- used  (https://www.thenewsapi.com/) to get a free api token
- used getX for statemanagement
- used http for api integration
- used cached_network_image for caching network images
- used mockito: ^5.4.2  and  build_runner: ^2.4.6 for api mocking
- pinch to zoom feature added
- MVC architecture implement
- check this (https://github.com/SupriyaVaniM/lmg_news_app_demo) for code implementation
- use development branch
- splash screen added that stays for 3 seconds

- Gentle note the token expires after every usage of 100 requests
- if data is not loading its probably because of the api token expiration 
- please sign up with any valid account in the (https://www.thenewsapi.com/) website 
- get a api token and replace it with existing apiKey of constants.dart file from the core folder and re run the app
